				<dt>Why is the catering menu different from the menu in the café?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p><strong>Answer: </strong><br />
						Our catering menu is designed for parties, groups and meetings. Our pricing includes built-in discounts because we are feeding more people.  We also take extra care in our packaging.  For example, with some menu items, we wrap and label every sandwich individually so customers know exactly what's inside. </p>
