This an important note for the users that are going to

upgrade the plugin from any version older that 2.5 to this version 2.6

**************************************

After installing the version 2.6, it's required to regenerate all the

markers in order to display them in the map. Otherwise, you'll have an

empty map with no markers.


To regenerate the markers, please go to the new section in the plugin

settings page called "Troubleshootings & Configs" and click on the 

button "Regenerate markers".


Thank you for using Progress Map and don't forget to rate the plugin

if you like it :)
